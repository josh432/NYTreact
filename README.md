## Comments

I ran into a major hiccup programming this app. My local machine stopped running react, but not before I completed and committed the code. I had to reset my PC, and my machine is to blame for the minimal styling. I will return to this repo to style this app further. But, it works! This technical issue came at a bad time, and I lost a few days of development because of this. This was by far the most difficult project to date for me to code, as I'm entirely new to programming in react. Thanks to my instructor Mark, my TA's Jasmine and Drew, and my classmate Becky for helping me, and being patient during this technical problem!!
